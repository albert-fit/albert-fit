# 👋 Hey, I'm Albert!

### 🌍 Geospatial and Machine Learning Enthusiast 🤖

Welcome to my GitHub playground! I'm on a journey through the exciting world of geospatial and machine learning engineering. 🌍✨ I believe in the power of data and code to make our world a better place, and I'm here to share my passion and discoveries with you.



## 🚀 What I'm Passionate About

- 🐍 Python: I'm in a committed relationship with Python. From data wrangling to machine learning, I am developing my undesrtanding of Python and the countless amazing packages developed by the community.
- ⚛️ React.js: Building beautiful and interactive web applications with React is my jam. I love crafting user experiences that delight. I am currently developing the [site-portal](https://www.site-portal.co.uk) geospatial platform for exploring drone photos and point clouds.
- 🚀 Node.js: The backend is just as exciting! I enjoy working with Node.js to create robust server-side applications. 
- 🌐 Three.js: I dabble in 3D web graphics with Three.js. Bringing data to life in 3D is pure magic.
- 🍃 MongoDB: NoSQL databases like MongoDB are my go-to for handling geospatial data. They make it feel like a breeze. I am a MongoDB certified developer.

## 🌟 What's in My GitHub Repository?

You'll find a mix of projects, from geospatial data analysis and visualization to machine learning models and web applications. I love to experiment and learn, so expect the unexpected!
