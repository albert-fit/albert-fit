# 👋 Hey, I'm Albert!

### 🌍 Geospatial and Machine Learning Enthusiast 🤖

Welcome to my GitHub playground! I'm on a journey through the exciting world of geospatial and machine learning engineering. 🌍✨ I believe in the power of data and code to make our world a better place, and I'm here to share my passion and discoveries with you.



## 🚀 What I'm Passionate About
- 🐍 Python & ML: I am currently learning about machine learning in Python and am taking great pleasure in learning about various neural networks concepts. Have recently attended a day of Arena 2.0 training which has sparked my interest in Generative Pre-trained Transformers.
- ⚛️ React.js: Building beautiful and interactive web applications with React is my jam. I love crafting user experiences that delight. I am currently developing the [site-portal](https://www.site-portal.co.uk) geospatial platform for exploring drone photos and point clouds.
- 🚀 Node: The backend is just as exciting! I enjoy working with Node.js to create robust server-side applications.
- 🦁 NestJs: Recently adopted Nest as a way to design better documented and more stable REST APIs.
- 🍃 MongoDB: I am an certified associate MongoDB developer and enjoy crafting efficient queries that can be used to get the right amount of data with the least latency.
- 🐘 PostreSQL: I am currently studying implementation of PostregSQL with TypeORM in NestJS.
- ☁️ Cloud (AWS and GCP): I love the idea that we can develop apps that can be deployed without building and running a datacenter. Am currently working towards the Cloud Practitioner certification in AWS.
- #️⃣ Terraform: Infrastructure as Code is something that I am passionate about because it enables me to define and deploy resources programatically. 

## 🌟 What's in My GitHub Repository?

You'll find a mix of projects, from geospatial data analysis and visualization to machine learning models and web applications. I love to experiment and learn, so expect the unexpected!
